Java program is all about creating a class.
Class means a category or a type which we create as developers.

keyword : class
identifier : MyApp
{} : scope or definition of class

public: access specifier : accessible everywhere
static: access modifier : makes main to be a property of MyApp class
void : return type of main function
main : name of the function. This will be executed automatically when we will execute Java i.e. whatever we write in main, will be executed.
String[] args: Command Line Arguments

Code in the main function is executed in a sequence.

We will get n number of .class files as a compilation result. For execution we must use that class which contains main function.
